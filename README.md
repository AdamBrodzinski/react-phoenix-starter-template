# React/Phoenix Starter Template

My goal with this repo is to provide a starter template for those looking to use React with Phoenix. The React app is separate from the Phoenix app so that you can serve up the static React app from a CDN and then have it talk to the Phoenix API.

## Features

1) React

2) React Router 

3) Redux

4) CSS Modules

5) CSS Next
